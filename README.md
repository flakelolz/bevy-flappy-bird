My attempt at making a feature complete Flappy bird clone to learn the bevy engine.
I wanted to make a game I could "finish". I was intuiting how things might work on the original based on gameplay footage alone
and trying to come up with a solution with the tools and knowledge I had of how Bevy works, so I feel good about this.

The most difficult part was the UI. I only used the basic Bevy UI nodes and that was a nightmare since I'm very bad at anything that
has to do with UI at the moment.

Still don't know how to Make things scale properly with screen size so I locked it to the native resolution of the assets I got.
